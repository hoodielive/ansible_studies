# Understanding Ansible Galaxy:

DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL!

The ansible-galaxy utility creates and removes roles or install roles from Ansible Galaxy or a git-based scm (software configuration management).

Syntax:
[delete|import|info|init|install|list|login|remove|search|setup] [--help] [options]
