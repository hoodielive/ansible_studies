# Understanding Roles

- The default location for roles is /etc/ansible/roles.
- Roles provide a way to automatically load certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on known file structures.
- Roles expect a particular directory structure.
- Directories not being used may be excluded.
- Each directory in use most contain a main.yml with relavant content.
